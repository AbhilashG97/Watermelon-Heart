Hello, 

Welcome to my blog! 

In this post I'll write a bit about myself and the things I have been doing so far. 

I am Abhilash Gunasegaran, a senior at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. 

I am an experienced mobile app developer who also has a good grasp on the fundamentals of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

I really like working with Android, IoT and NLP. I'm also an open source enthusiast and I contribute to open source software whenever I get some free time. This year I also got the opportunity to mentor in Google Summer of Code for Mifos Intiative. It was an amazing experience.

Here are some of the projects that I have worked on - 

1.  [**Created a CLI based student-tracking application**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/WatermelonCupcake): In this project, a user is able to track the overall progress of a student by keeping track of a studentâ€™s grades, extra-curricular activities, attendance and arrears if any. 

1.  [**Built a Fitness Kiosk**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Fitness-Kiosk): This is an IoT based project which measures various parameters of a user such as their height, weight, pulse and body temperature. These parameters are then used to provide the user with a workout plan, nutrition plan and overall fitness report. The user can also view this information on a mobile app.

1.  [**Student Management System**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Jalebi): This is a JavaFX project built using MVC architecture where a student, faculty and an administrator are provided with a common medium to interact with each other. 

1.  [**Smart Fire Alarm**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Awesome-Fire-Alarm): ESP Microcontroller takes live temperature and warns the user if the temperature gets excessively high. The mobile client for the device also allows the user to remotely control the IoT device an app.

1.  [**Generating a scene from speech**](): This project generates a scene depending on what the user says. Attentional Generative Adversarial Networks (attnGAN) is used to generate the scene. Currently, the domain of the scene that is being generated is limited to birds only. This project is currently present in a private repository. 

1.  [**Melonicious**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Melonicious): An Android app that tracks the daily commits of a given set of GitHub users.

Here are some GitHub repositories that I maintain regularly - 

1.  [**Watermelon Snowball**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Watermelon-Snowball): A repository that contains resources, notes and sample projects on Natural Language Processing.

1.  [**Watermelon Icecream**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/Watermelon-Icecream): This repository contains all Java programs which I've written while learning and experimenting with Java.

1.  [**Watermelon Mochi**](https://github.com/AbhilashG97/WatermelonMochi): This repository will house solutions to all the assignments given to me during my engineering course and also various other academic resources.
